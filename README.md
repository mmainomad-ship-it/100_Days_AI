🤖 100-Project GenAI & Agentic Portfolio Challenge
This repository documents my intensive, self-driven journey to build a job-ready portfolio by completing 100 Python/AI projects in 45 days.
Starting as a beginner in Python, the goal is to rapidly transition to an Intermediate ML Engineer/GenAI Developer level through aggressive daily coding and deployment, leveraging AI and open-source tools as learning accelerators.
The 100 projects are structured to progressively increase in complexity, moving from foundational coding skills to advanced agentic systems.
